# Expo Camera: Inconsistent Pixel Data Access in Custom Image Processing

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered when using the Expo Camera API for custom image processing. The issue involves inconsistencies when accessing pixel data from captured images, leading to unexpected errors or incorrect data.

## Bug Description

When processing images captured using the Expo Camera API and attempting to access pixel data using methods such as `getImageData()`, the results may be inconsistent or inaccurate. This issue is not consistently reproducible and seems to be related to specific device hardware or image properties.  This can lead to unpredictable behavior in applications relying on precise pixel manipulation.

## Reproduction

The `bug.js` file contains code demonstrating how to reproduce this error. This involves capturing an image and then attempting to access and process its pixel data.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file offers a possible solution by implementing error handling and potentially adding image preprocessing steps to mitigate the issue. The exact solution may depend on the specific circumstances and the nature of the image data being processed. The solution employs robust error handling and image data validation to handle potential inconsistencies.  Further investigation into the root cause is still ongoing.

## Contributing

Contributions to improve this solution and identify the root cause are welcome.
